This code not only shows the total count of fingers, but also displays a bounding box around the detected hand.
Additionally, it uses the model's hand classification feature to distinguish between the left and right hand and
adjust the thumb detection accordingly. If it's a left hand, the logic for thumb detection flips. It assumes the
webcam is in a regular position (i.e., not mirrored). If your webcam is mirrored, you might need to adjust the
thumb detection logic.
